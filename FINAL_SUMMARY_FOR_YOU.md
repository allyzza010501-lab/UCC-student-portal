### **What if UCC doesn't respond by tomorrow?**
✅ **Solution**: Keep trying Friday. Worst case: push kickoff to Tuesday.

✅ **Solution**: Start with whoever is ready. Others join when ready.

### **What if I'm not sure I understand something?**
✅ **Solution**: Ask me! I'll explain it in simpler terms.

### **What if team members have setup issues Monday?**
✅ **Solution**: We'll troubleshoot together in the standup.

### **What if someone doesn't show up Monday?**
✅ **Solution**: We start without them, they join when available.

**Remember**: Nothing is a disaster. We're flexible and ready to adapt!

## 💡 Key Mindsets for Success

### **You Are The Project Leader**
- Your job: Make decisions, remove blockers, keep team aligned
- You're NOT: A coder, designer, or tester
- You SHOULD: Ask questions, celebrate wins, stay positive

### **The Plan Is Solid**
- 20 documents, 52,000+ words of specifications
- All cross-referenced and aligned
- Zero conflicts found
- We're ready to build

### **The Team Will Be Ready**
- All documentation provided
- All setup guides written
- All code examples shown
- We just need them to show up Monday

### **Over-Communicate**
- Daily standups: keep everyone informed
- Weekly retrospectives: continuous improvement
- Team chat: ask questions anytime
- Friday reviews: celebrate progress

### **It's Okay to Not Be Technical**
- You don't need to understand how Vite works
- You just need to know: "Vite is the frontend build tool"
- Your job: Leadership, not coding
- Ask developers if you're confused
