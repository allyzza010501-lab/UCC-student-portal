## 🎓 Design Philosophy

> **"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."** — Steve Jobs

This platform will be designed with UCC students at the center. Every pixel, every interaction, every word choice will serve the goal of creating a safe, elegant, inspiring space where students feel heard, valued, and connected.

The design will honor UCC's prestigious heritage while boldly claiming a place in the modern digital landscape. It will be beautiful because it's honest. It will be powerful because it listens.
